## Problem
1. Performance Degradation: It may lead to performance degradation as load balancers assign equivalent or predetermined weights to diverse resources and therefore it can result in poor performance in terms of speed and cost. Therefore, it is the need to have effective load balancers which balance load depending upon the type of resources.
2. Load Estimation: There is no way to determine or predict the load or the total number of processes on a node since the demand for process resources fluctuates quickly.
3. Performance Indices: The performance indices of the system should not degrade anything more than a particular point. Load balancers should provide stability. So they need to make sure that during extreme events like- when the number of requests from the server increases drastically.
4. Security: It also deals with some security issues. It is vulnerable to attacks. This issue can be minimized to a larger extent by using cloud load balancing. They are less prone to attacks.

### Solution for Problem 1. Define IP or DNS name for LB: Administrators define one IP address and/or DNS name for a given application, task, or website, to which all requests will come. This IP address or DNS name is the load balancing server.
### Solution for Problem 2. Add backend pool for LB: The administrator will then enter into the load balancing server the IP addresses of all the actual servers that will be sharing the workload for a given application or task. This pool of available servers is only accessible internally, via the load balancer.
### Solution for Problem 3. Deploy LB: Finally, your load balancer needs to be deployed — either as a proxy, which sits between your app servers and your users worldwide and accepts all traffic, or as a gateway, which assigns a user to a server once and leaves the interaction alone thereafter.
### Solution for Problem 4. N/A
