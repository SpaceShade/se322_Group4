## Problem
1. Single Service Failure Impacting the Entire Architecture
2. Slow External Service Affecting Independent Services
3. Unavailability of Database or Server
4. Long Response Times Causing Delays
5. Lack of Isolation in Service Communication

### Solution for Problem 1. Implement duplicate instances of services and leverage service discovery and client-side load balancing mechanisms. This allows the system to route requests to available instances when one service is down, minimizing the impact on the entire architecture.
### Solution for Problem 2. Set timeouts for requests to external services to prevent them from blocking the thread pool. Implementing circuit breaker patterns can help detect and temporarily deactivate problematic components, allowing other services to function smoothly. 
### Solution for Problem 3. Implement retry mechanisms to automatically retry failed connections to databases or servers. This can help recover from temporary issues and reduce the impact of failures.
### Solution for Problem 4. Set appropriate timeouts for service-to-service communication to avoid waiting indefinitely for responses. If a service does not respond within the specified time, throw an exception and stop the request to prevent cascading delays.
### Solution for Problem 5. Apply the bulkhead pattern to isolate services into separate pools or partitions. If one service fails or experiences issues, the others can continue to function independently, preventing the failure from spreading across the architecture.
