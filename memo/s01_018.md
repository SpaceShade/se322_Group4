## Problem
1. In a distributed system, the complexity of interactions between multiple components can lead to various challenges and issues. These problems can hinder the system's reliability and effectiveness.

### Solution for Problem 1. 
- Fault-tolerant design: Implement mechanisms that allow the system to recover from
component failures without performing incorrect actions. This can include redundancy,
replication, and error detection and recovery mechanisms.
- Highly available architecture: Design the system in a way that enables it to restore
operations and continue providing services even when some components have failed. This can involve load balancing, failover mechanisms, and the ability to dynamically allocate resources.
- Recoverability mechanisms: Implement processes that allow failed components to restart themselves and rejoin the system once the cause of the failure has been repaired. This can include checkpointing, logging, and state management techniques.
- Consistency management: Develop mechanisms to coordinate actions by multiple components, especially in the presence of concurrency and failure. This ensures that the distributed system behaves consistently and can provide services similar to a non- distributed system. Techniques like distributed transactions and consensus algorithms can be employed.
- Scalable architecture: Design the system to operate correctly even as its size is scaled up. Consider increasing the number of users, resources, servers, or overall load on the system. A scalable system should handle these increases without significant degradation in performance or reliability. This may involve partitioning data, using distributed caching, or employing scalable communication protocols.
