## problem
1.Heterogeneity
2.Openness
3.Security
4.Synchronization
5.Absence of global clock
6.Partial failures
7.Scalability
8.transparency

### solution for problem 1.
The distributed system contains many different kinds of hardware and software working together in cooperative fashion to solve problems.
### solution for problem 2.
Open systems are characterized by the fact that their key interfaces are published
Open distributed systems are based on the provision of a uniform communication mechanism and published interfaces for access to shared resources
Open distributed systems can be constructed from heterogeneous hardware and software, possibly from different vendors
### solution for problem 3.
Shared data must be protected 
### solution for problem 4.
Concurrent cooperating tasks need to synchronize
### solution for problem 5.
Cooperating task need to agree on the order of events
### solution for problem 6.
Detection of failures - may be impossible
### solution for problem 7.
Avoiding performance bottlenecks

## Decision Driver 1.
- Distributed systems often involve a diverse range of hardware, software, and network technologies. 
- Openness refers to the ability of a distributed system to integrate and interact with other systems seamlessly.
- Security is a critical concern in distributed systems due to the increased complexity and potential vulnerabilities.
- Distributed systems often face challenges in achieving and maintaining synchronization among distributed components.
- Distributed systems typically lack a global clock, making it challenging to establish a common time reference across all components.
- Distributed systems are susceptible to partial failures, where individual components or network links may fail while others remain operational.
- Distributed systems often need to handle increasing workloads and accommodate growing numbers of users or components.
- Transparency refers to hiding the complexities of distributed systems from users and applications.
