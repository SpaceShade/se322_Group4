## Problem
1. Transmission medium: physical path between the start and endpoints. So system latency depends on the type of medium used to transmit requests.
2. Propagation: It refers to the amount of time required for a packet to travel
from one source to another.
3. Router: Routers are an essential component in communication and take some
time to analyze the header information of a packet.
4. Storage delay: System latency also depends on the type of storage system
used.

### Solution for Problem 1. HTTP/2: We can reduce latency by the use of HTTP/2. It allows parallelized transfers and minimizes round trips from the sender to the receiver.
### Solution for Problem 2. Less external HTTP requests: Latency increases because of third-party services
### Solution for Problem 3. CDN: CDN stores resources in multiple locations worldwide and reduces the request and response travel time.
### Solution for Problem 4. Browser Caching: Browser caching can also help to reduce the latency.
