## Problem
1. The development organization faces challenges in creating reusable components or products based on reusable components, despite their success in other areas. The development process becomes more complex as reusable components are developed, requiring extensive support and consideration from the organization.

### Solution for Problem 1. 
- Design Planning: Establish a well-defined design planning process that focuses on the identification and creation of reusable components. This includes defining clear specifications, standardizing interfaces, and considering future requirements for reusability.
- Component Development: Allocate dedicated resources and expertise for developing reusable components. Implement rigorous development practices, such as modular design, thorough testing, and documentation to ensure the quality and reliability of the components.
- Maintenance and Support: Create a specialized team responsible for the maintenance and support of reusable components. This team should be equipped to handle the complexities associated with maintaining and updating the components, providing timely bug fixes, and addressing compatibility issues.
