## Problem
1. Timing failure occurs when a node in a system correctly sends a response, but
the response arrives earlier or later than anticipated. Timing failures, also known as performance failures, occur when a node delivers a response that is either earlier or later than anticipated.
2. When a server’s response is flawed, a response failure occurs. The response’s
value could be off or transmitted using the inappropriate control flow.
3. A timing issue known as an “infinite late” or omission failure occurs when the
node’s answer never appears to have been sent.
4. If a node encounters an omission failure once and then totally stops responding and goes unresponsive, this is known as a crash failure.
5. A server may produce arbitrary response at arbitrary times.

### Solution for Problem 1. Implement proper synchronization mechanisms, such as using timestamps or synchronized clocks, to ensure consistent timing across distributed components.
### Solution for Problem 2. Implement robust error handling and validation mechanisms to detect and handle flawed or incorrect responses from servers, Employ proper error handling protocols and implement suitable control flow mechanisms to ensure correct responses.
### Solution for Problem 3. Use acknowledgement mechanisms or heartbeat protocols to detect if a response has been omitted or delayed indefinitely.
### Solution for Problem 4. Implement fault detection and recovery mechanisms to identify crashed nodes and initiate appropriate actions such as restarting the failed components.
### Solution for Problem 5. Implement rigorous security measures such as authentication and access control to prevent servers from producing arbitrary responses.
