## Problem
1. Making a hardware fault-tolerance is simple as compared to software. Fault-tolerance techniques make the hardware work proper and give correct result even some fault occurs in the hardware part of the system. There are basically two techniques used for hardware fault-tolerance

### Solution for Problem 1. 
- BIST: BIST stands for Build in Self Test. System carries out the test of itself after a certain period of time again and again, that is BIST technique for hardware fault-tolerance. When system detects a fault, it switches out the faulty component and switches in the redundant of it. System basically reconfigure itself in case of fault occurrence.
- TMR: TMR is Triple Modular Redundancy. Three redundant copies of critical components are generated and all these three copies are run concurrently. Voting of result of all redundant copies are done and majority result is selected. It can tolerate the occurrence of a single fault at a time.
