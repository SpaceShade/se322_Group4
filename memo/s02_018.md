## Problem
1. Expensive queries in OLAP databases, if you store lots of data without planning for its intended use, you’ll eventually run into performance and cost problems. This concept applies to pretty much any type of storage, but we see it the most with OLAP databases.
2. Repeating the same query, queries over large datasets cost time, compute resources, money, or a combination. One way to mitigate this is to reduce query complexity; another is to reduce frequency.
3.  Rigid pipeline architecture, healthy data scaling usually requires some form of transformation to maximize efficiency

### Solution for Problem 1. Joining your data, a great way to begin to broadly simplify your queries. This may seem counter-intuitive because joining doesn’t necessarily reduce data volume; in fact, many types of joins increase data volume.
### Solution for Problem 2. Materialized view is a smaller data object that contains the subset of data resulting from a specific query.
### Solution for Problem 3. Perform a lighter transformation before loading into the warehouse, where you’ll retain an intermediate level of detail
