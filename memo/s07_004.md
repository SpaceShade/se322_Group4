## Problem
1. Ignoring website performance: Many businesses overlook the importance of monitoring and optimizing website performance, which can lead to downtime, slow loading times, and a negative user experience.
2. Cost of website downtime: Major website crashes can result in significant financial losses, as seen in examples like Amazon and Facebook.
3. First impression and user perception: Website performance, particularly page loading speed, contributes to the overall impression users form about a company or brand.
4. Lack of proactive issue detection: Without website monitoring, businesses may not be aware of performance issues until users report them, causing delays in resolving problems.
5. Inadequate site optimization: The passage briefly mentions technical optimization aspects like checking robots.txt, validating .htaccess files, code updates, and handling 404 errors. Neglecting these optimizations can impact website visibility and user experience.

### Solution for Problem 1. Implement website performance monitoring: Conduct regular checks to minimize fault time, optimize page loading, and ensure the best possible user experience.
### Solution for Problem 2. Use Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools: APM tools like Retrace can provide deep integration, measure performance, and help troubleshoot and fix issues before they affect users.
### Solution for Problem 3. Establish a regular monitoring schedule: Monthly monitoring is recommended to stay proactive and identify patterns and trends over time, allowing businesses to prepare for traffic surges and prevent financial losses.
### Solution for Problem 4. Combine technical and external optimization: Perform technical optimizations such as checking robots.txt and validating .htaccess files. Additionally, focus on external optimization, including meta tags, content optimization, internal page linking, and content marketing strategies.
### Solution for Problem 5. Prioritize diversification and user experience: Offer stunning content, great designs, and high performance to provide the best possible experience for website visitors.
