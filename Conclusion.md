Increased maintainability implies shorter repair times. This encompasses how simple and fast it is to get back to full operations when a failure occurs. If the time it takes to repair a system is low, the more available a system is. (s07_002)
##  Driver  1.) Test-and-Set instruction won't work (s01_001)

##  Driver  1.) N/A

##  Problem 15) Downtime and wait time in Recreate Deployment. (s01_004)
##  Solution 1.) Recreate deployment, where the old version is completely shut down and the new version is deployed from scratch, can result in downtime for end users. However, it is a cost-effective strategy when starting from scratch. (s01_004)
##  Driver  1.) N/A

##  Problem 16) Long rollback duration in Ramped Deployment. (s01_004)
##  Solution 1.) Ramped deployment gradually replaces instances of the older version with instances from the new version, resulting in zero downtime. However, if an unexpected event occurs, the rollback process can be time-consuming. (s01_004)

##  Solution 1.)  A/B testing deployment involves deploying the new version alongside the old version but making it available to a subset of users. This allows for measuring the effectiveness of new functionality. However, setting up A/B testing can be complex and requires a sophisticated load balancer. (s01_004)
##  Solution 2.)Need to be well-attentive when handling communication and security (s03_001)
##  Solution 3.)Software and Hardware (s04_001)

##  Driver  1.) The complexity of the system or the interactions between many nodes


##  Problem 19) Monolithic programs make code reuse difficult and make it hard for teams to coordinate change. (s01_029)
##  Solution 1.)  Build clients that reuse lots of smaller components that share connection resources to access application services. Instances are typically created and destroyed often. They are typically graphical in nature and do not communicate directly with other components; instead, glue is used to tie them together. (s01_029)
##  Driver  1.) Lack of modularity and slow development cycles (s01_029)

##  Problem 20) Designing a new system or breaking an existing up into too many components can result in overly complex and defective systems. BigBallOfMud often results. (s01_029)
##  Solution 1.) Build servers that consist of a defined set of larger, reusable components plugged into an application infrastructure that supports fault tolerance, is scalable, and pools server-side connection resources with clients. Instances are typically shared across many client sessions. They are typically not graphical and communicate with other services and external legacy and data services. (s01_029)
##  Driver  1.) Insufficient consideration of system-wide architecture and lack of clear system boundaries (s01_029)

##  Problem 21) Too much application logic in the client application (also known as TooMuchGuiCode) increases complexity, hardening arteries and causing high blood pressure in fat laboratory mice. (s01_029)

##  Driver  1.) N/A

##  Solution 1.) N/A
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 35) Complexity makes diagnosing problems on an on-going basis more tedious (translation: pricier and less effective). (s02_002)
##  Solution 1.)  Code: Inexperienced developers tend to overlook code considerations when planning for scalability. Code should be written so that it can be added to or modified without refactoring the old code. Good developers aim to avoid duplication of effort, reducing the overall size and complexity of the codebase. (s02_002)
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 36) Users experience slow loading times because the server takes too long to respond to requests. Other potential issues include decreased availability or even lost data. (s02_002)
##  Solution 1.)  Usage: Usage measures the number of simultaneous users or connections possible. There shouldn’t be any artificial limits on usage. Increasing it should be as simple as making more resources available to the software. (s02_002)
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 37)1. Load Balancer Scaling When considering load balancer scaling and load balancer scalability, it is important to understand how to effectively scale load balancers to meet the demands of increasing network traffic. Scaling a load balancer ensures that it can handle the workload and distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers, preventing any single server from being overloaded. (s02_004)
##  Solution 1.) - Determine the load balancer requirements: Understand the specific requirements of your application and the expected load. Consider factors such as the number of concurrent requests, traffic patterns, and protocols used.- Choose a scalable load balancer architecture: Decide whether to scale up or scale out. Scaling up involves adding more resources to an existing load balancer, such as CPU, memory, or disk space. Scaling out involves adding additional load balancers to distribute the load across multiple nodes.- Implement virtual IP addressing: Use a virtual IP address (VIP) to represent the load balancer and distribute incoming requests to the most appropriate server based on a defined algorithm. The VIP allows multiple devices to share a public IP address, enabling scalability.- Select a load balancing algorithm: Choose an appropriate load balancing algorithm based on your application requirements. Common algorithms include round-robin, weighted round-robin, URL hash, least connection, weighted least connection, and least response time. Each algorithm has its own characteristics and is suitable for different scenarios.- Configure health checks: Set up health checks to monitor the availability and health of servers in the pool. This ensures that only healthy servers receive traffic and avoids directing requests to a failed or overloaded server. (s02_004)
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 38) Expensive queries in OLAP databases, if you store lots of data without planning for its intended use, you’ll eventually run into performance and cost problems. This concept applies to pretty much any type of storage, but we see it the most with OLAP databases. (s02_018)
##  Solution 1.) Joining your data, a great way to begin to broadly simplify your queries. This may seem counter-intuitive because joining doesn’t necessarily reduce data volume; in fact, many types of joins increase data volume.(s02_018)
##  Driver  1.) N/A

##  Problem 39) Repeating the same query, queries over large datasets cost time, compute resources, money, or a combination. One way to mitigate this is to reduce query complexity; another is to reduce frequency. (s02_018)
##  Solution 1.) Materialized view is a smaller data object that contains the subset of data resulting from a specific query. (s02_018)
##  Driver  1.) N/A

##  Problem 40)  Rigid pipeline architecture, healthy data scaling usually requires some form of transformation to maximize efficiency (s02_018)
##  Solution 1.) Perform a lighter transformation before loading into the warehouse, where you’ll retain an intermediate level of detail (s02_018)
##  Driver  1.) N/A

##  Problem 41) Distributed systems are more complex than systems that run on a single processor. (s02_029, s03_001)
##  Solution 1.) N/A 
##  Driver  1.)  Here are some key factors that contribute to the increased complexity: 1. Communication and coordination: 2. Concurrency and parallelism 3. Fault tolerance and reliability: 4. Data consistency and replication: 5. Scalability and performance:  6. Security and privacy 7. Configuration and deployment (s02_029)

##  Solution 1.) N/A
##  Driver  1.) All the nodes try to send data at a single instant of time (s03_001)

##  Problem 48) Atomicity: all the steps of a transaction is succeeded or failed together, no partial state, all or nothing. (s03_002)
##  Solution 1.)  Choreography-based SAGA: No central coordinator exists in this case. Each service produces an event after completion of its task and each service listens to events to take an action. This pattern requires an mature event-driven architecture. (s03_002)
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 49) Consistency: all data in the database is consistent at the end of transaction. (s03_002)
##  Solution 1.) Eventual consistency is a model used in distributed systems to achieve high availability. In an eventual consistent system, inconsistencies are allowed for a short time until solving the problem of distributed data.This model doesn’t apply to distributed ACID transactions across microservices. Eventual consistency uses the BASE database model. (s03_002)
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 50) Isolation: only one transaction can touch the data in the same time, other transactions wait until completion of the working transaction. (s03_002)
##  Solution 1.) Distributed Transactions In a distributed transaction, transactions are executed on two or more resources. Data integrity is guaranteed across multiple databases by distributed transaction manager or coordinator. (s03_002)
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 51) Durability: data is persisted in the database at the end of the transaction (s03_002)
##  Solution 1.) N/A
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 52) Poor Documentation (s03_004)
##  Solution 1.)  Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation is crucial for developers to understand how to use an API effectively. Providing clear and detailed documentation, including API endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, error handling, and examples, can help developers integrate the API seamlessly.(s03_004)
##  Driver  1.) N/A

##  Problem 53) Lack of Versioning (s03_004)
##  Solution 1.) APIs undergo updates and enhancements over time. Without proper versioning, changes to the API can break existing integrations. Implementing versioning in the API allows developers to choose the version they want to use, ensuring backward compatibility and minimizing disruption to existing applications. (s03_004)
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 54) Inadequate Error Handling (s03_004, s03_029)
##  Solution 1.) APIs should provide informative and consistent error messages to help developers troubleshoot issues effectively. Clear error codes, error descriptions, and suggested resolutions can assist developers in understanding and resolving problems more efficiently. (s03_004)
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 55) Insufficient Rate Limiting (s03_004)
##  Solution 1.) Rate limiting is essential to prevent abuse and protect the API's resources. Implementing rate limits helps control the number of requests a client can make within a specific time period. By enforcing rate limits, the API can ensure fair usage and avoid performance degradation or security vulnerabilities. (s03_004)
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

##  Problem 56) Insecure Authentication and Authorization (s03_004)
##  Solution 1.) APIs should use secure authentication mechanisms, such as API keys, tokens, or OAuth, to ensure that only authorized users can access the API. Employing encryption and secure protocols like HTTPS can further enhance the security of data transmission between the client and the API server. (s03_004)
##  Driver  1.) N/A 

 ##  Problem 57) Making a hardware fault-tolerance is simple as compared to software. Fault-tolerance techniques make the hardware work proper and give correct result even some fault occurs in the hardware part of the system. There are basically two techniques used for hardware fault-tolerance (s03_018)
 ##  Solution 1.) - BIST: BIST stands for Build in Self Test. System carries out the test of itself after a certain period of time again and again, that is BIST technique for hardware fault-tolerance. When system detects a fault, it switches out the faulty component and switches in the redundant of it. System basically reconfigure itself in case of fault occurrence. - TMR: TMR is Triple Modular Redundancy. Three redundant copies of critical components are generated and all these three copies are run concurrently. Voting of result of all redundant copies are done and majority result is selected. It can tolerate the occurrence of a single fault at a time. (s03_018)

##  Problem 58) Openness (s03_029, s04_029, s04_501, s06_029, s07_001, s07_029)
##  Solution 1.) Open systems are characterized by the fact that their key interfaces are published Open distributed systems are based on the provision of a uniform communication mechanism and published interfaces for access to shared resources Open distributed systems can be constructed from heterogeneous hardware and software, possibly from different vendors(s06_029)

##  Solution 1.) Should be abstracted and addressed logically rather than physically (s07_001)
##  Driver  1.) Transparency refers to hiding the complexities of distributed systems from users and applications.(s06_029)

##  Problem 61) Quality (s03_029, s04_004, s04_029, s05_501, s06_50, s07_001)

##  Problem 73) Software fault tolerance is a necessary component to construct the next generation of highly available and reliable computing systems from embedded systems to data warehouse systems. (s04_002)
##  Solution 1.) Recovery Block is The recovery block method is a simple technique developed by Randel. The recovery block operates with an adjudicator, which confirms the results of various implementations of the same algorithm. In a system with recovery blocks, the system view is broken down into fault recoverable blocks. (s04_002)

##  Problem 74) Software faults are all design faults. Software manufacturing, the reproduction of software, is considered to be perfect. The source of the problem being solely designed faults is very different than almost any other system in which fault tolerance is the desired property.(s04_002)
##  Solution 1.) N-Version SoftwareThe is methods attempt to parallel the traditional hardware fault tolerance concept of N-way redundant hardware. In an N- version software system, every module is done with up to N different methods. Each variant accomplishes the same function, but hopefully in a various way. Each version then submits its answer to voter or decider, which decides the correct answer, and returns that as the result of the module. (s04_002)

##  Problem 75) Security in distributed systems introduces two specific concerns that centralized systems do not have. The first is the use of a network where contents may be seen by other, possibly malicious, parties. The second is the use of servers. (s04_018)
##  Solution 1.) Asymmetric power. Actors can project or harness significant force for attack. This differs dramatically from the physical world where, for example, a small nation would not risk attacking a large one that could easily overpower it. Offense can be much more effective than defense. The person or people who started Conflicker were able to harness the power of millions of computers worldwide that they could use to launch attacks or crack passwords. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an example of the use of asymmetric force. A company has only so many servers on the network. If an attacker can harness a large number of computers to send requests to the company’s servers, the servers will get overloaded and be unable to process legitimate requests. With a DDoS attack, the attacker will assemble a botnet by attacking a large set of computers and infectious them with malicious software (malware). These computers, owned by innocent people, will periodically contact a command & control server to receive directions on what attack to carry out.(s04_018)
##  Driver  1.) N/A  

##  Problem 76) Risks introduced by the Internet: The Internet provides us with a powerful mechanism for communicating with practically any other computer in the world. It also provides a way for attackers to target systems from practically any other computer in the world. (s04_018)
##  Solution 1.) Action at a distance. Attackers do not need to be physically present by the computer to attack it. They can also be in a different state or even a different country. And actors can be anonymous. Actors can be anonymous. No one knows with any certainty who ran some of the biggest attacks that the world has ever experienced. Trust becomes a big challenge.

##  Problem 79) Software Limitations: Although a massive amount of time, energy, communication, and organization goes into application software development, it could be the source of the constricting bottleneck. (s05_002)
##  Solution 1.) Software bottlenecks There’s a lot that depends on the code you write – the framework you use, the libraries you import, and the development practices you follow. A software bottleneck refers to the situation when your code/software/program is the limiting factor in your setup – when it stymies an application from reaching its maximum performance potential. Network bottlenecks can usually be avoided by upgrading and augmenting the networking infrastructure – routers, switches, hubs, and access points, and examining your users’ geographical distribution, and setting up servers and CDNs accordingly.

##  Problem 80)  CPU Utilization: The CPU is a likely culprit for most performance bottlenecks. This occurs when the processor cannot perform the requests asked of it. Too many processing requests can overload the system, causing slow-downs. CPUs run database inquiries, handle information requests, execute programs, and process data. A bottleneck arises when the data that can be processed are less than the data waiting to be processed. (s05_002)
